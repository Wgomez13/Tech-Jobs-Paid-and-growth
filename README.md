# Tech-Jobs-Paid-and-growth
Data analysis and visualization on python
For this project I have two questions.

1- Has a web developers pay increased in the Louisville area in the past four years?

2- Have the number of jobs in web developing increased in the Louisville area in the past four years?

I wanted to know if the jobs demand matched the job pay for web developer jobs in the Louisville area for the past four years. 

I got this data from KYSTATS.gov. The Kentucky Center for Statistics collects and integrates education and workforce data so 
that policymakers, practitioners and the public can make the best informed decisions possible. From the data that I got from
them, I only used the tech jobs statistics. From that data, I chose the estimated job growth and the hourly job rate for the 
Kentuckiana Works zone.

I charted the hourly job rate with a line chart and the estimated job growth with a bar chart.

The final product concludes that the estimated job growth has increased. However, the hourly pay despite a three year steady 
increase from 2015-2017,  decreased in 2018.
